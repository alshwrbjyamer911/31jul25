A suitable font library for `sh1106.c` and `sh1106.h` is one that provides fonts in the format expected by the `Font_TypeDef` structure defined in `sh1106.h`. The font data should be an array of bytes, with metadata fields for width, height, bytes per character, scan direction, and character code range.

A commonly used compatible font library is the [GLCD Font Creator](https://www.mikroe.com/glcd-font-creator) output, or fonts from the [stm32-ssd1306](https://github.com/afiskon/stm32-ssd1306/tree/master/fonts) project, which are C arrays matching the expected structure.

You can also use the [u8g2 font converter](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2/wiki/fntconv) to generate compatible font arrays.

**Example:**  
- [stm32-ssd1306/fonts/font_7x10.c](https://github.com/afiskon/stm32-ssd1306/blob/master/fonts/font_7x10.c)
- [GLCD Font Creator output](https://www.mikroe.com/glcd-font-creator)

Make sure the font array and structure match the `Font_TypeDef` definition in your header.
